This repository contains the source code for all presentations I made for
public events.

Some of them are in LaTeX (compile with XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX), some are in Markdown
(compile with `pandoc`).

Each repository should contain a Makefile with the build command, and a
pre-compiled version in the `out/` subdirectory.
