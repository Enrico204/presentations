This repository contains the source code for all presentations I made for
public events.

Some of them are in LaTeX (compile with XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX), some are in Markdown
(compile with `pandoc` - tested with version 2.13).

Each repository should contain a Makefile with the build command, and a
pre-compiled version in the `out/` subdirectory.

Markdown slides can be compiled also with `reveal.js`. I like `moon`, `black`
and `white` themes.
